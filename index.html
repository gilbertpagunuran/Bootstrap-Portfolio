        <p>I completed my college course work in the Philippines with B.S. Computer Engineering degree and have more than 20 years of professional work experience since – mostly in development functionalities.  In my early years, I decided to stay in doing the gritty work of software development – which is coding.  I thought coding is fun and challenging and getting paid for something I enjoy doing naturally is a dream job. <br><br> I started my career working for a consulting company that develops and deploy software overseas.  It proved to be a good enterprise for it exposed me to places I never dreamed of visiting in my own time.  I have worked in the shipping, banking, brokerage and finance, pharmaceutical, health insurance and utility industries in different continents.  My work as a developer, technical designer and production support staff gave me different perspectives in working as a team player. <br>
        <br>  Flash forward 2017.  I’m raising a family - 2 kids of my own and 1 adopted boy from the Philippines.  I enjoy cooking, playing tennis and running.  Earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do with my son.  Took piano lessons with my daughter. And now learning a new thing they call Full-Stack Web Development before reaching the end of my 50th year on this planet. <br> 
        <br>  Why web development?  Besides piquing my curiosity, the idea of retooling my skillset for my next unknown adventure is exciting! Also, I wanted to test my brain’s elasticity and improve it.  I thought this is a good investment for my personal growth.  Coming from relational database world, I’d like to know and understand how is such a file system can be accessed without SQL!  I have been sleeping under the currents of computing.  Maybe if I learn these tools, I can finally make some of my ideas into reality…
